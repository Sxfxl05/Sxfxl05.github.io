# 🌐 Task 5 – GitHub Pages Deployment

This is a static website hosted on GitHub Pages using a custom username-based repo (`yourusername.github.io`).

## 🔧 How it was done:
1. Created a repo named `yourusername.github.io`
2. Uploaded static files (`index.html`, `style.css`)
3. GitHub auto-deployed to `https://yourusername.github.io`

✅ No frameworks or backend — pure HTML/CSS.
